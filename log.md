# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 4 & 6, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Git & Github, solved sum of integer program and palindrome program on Leetcode.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with this question, i approached it with user friendly approach, added input functionality, but there were multiple errors, i wrote about 17 lines of code but in the discussion section people solved the same in 3 lines!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
